            Tech is reshaping how we learn and come together. Software is ubiquitious and every<br>
             person can now build their way to a future that inspires them. However, today's world <br>
             isn't designed to work for these creators creating an imbalance between the impact<br>
             they're capable of, and what's expected of them.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p  style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">I'm working to solve this problem…</p>
        <br>
        <ul style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">
            <li>by creating better tools on GitHub for developers and formerly at Hackerbay<br> for hackers and companies;</li>
            <li>by building communities at Tea and formerly as co-founder of Hackevents<br> organizing hackathons across Germany, now by mentoring at hackathons around the world;</li>
            <li>by documenting open source projects on YouTube;</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;"> ...and through one commit at a time.</p>
        <br>
        <p  style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Currently, I am working as Chief Technology Officer at AQVC. It's an amazing place<br> where I get to work alongside great people on our vision to democratize the access to<br> venture capital.</p>
         <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">I'm currently living in Munich, Germany. Some other places I've lived in are Helsinki,<br> Berlin, San Francisco, Hong Kong, and Toronto.</p>
        <h2 style="font-size: 2em; color:azure">Previously</h2>
        <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">I founded and built Hackerbay as CTO with three awesome friends. We took a small<br> insight from hackathons – software is not a 12 month development cycle – and built up<br> a B2B company. We worked with Twitter, Vodafone, Allianz and some of Germany's<br> largest corporations. With NFX we had incredible investors on board and always an<br> open ear from James, Pete, or Gigi.</p>
        <h2 style="font-size: 2em; color:azure">Let's Connect</h2>   
        <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">
            I'm most active on Twitter and GitHub but you can also find me on LinkedIn. The<br> best way to contact me is either through Twitter, or my email at my first name @<br> mfts.io – my DMs and inbox are always open.
